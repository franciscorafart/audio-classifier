# Audio Classifier AI model

# Description
Building an audio classification app that can serve as a template for any audio classification project

# Technologies
- Python
    fastai, matplotlib, scipy
- Jupyter Notebooks
- JS / HTML / CSS

# Steps (TODO)
1. Pull wav files from external links with different audio categories
2. Transform audio to spectograms using matplotlib and scipy
3. Use FastAI to train a deel learning model with the spectrogram images
4. Export model
5. Deploy model and make it usable with an app
